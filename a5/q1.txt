this is an example of a deadlock because the angles can't move if they are being watched
but they end up in a state where their looking at each other, meaning none can move because they are being watched by themselves
and they can't stop watching each other since they can't move (can't move because their being watched)
=> deadlock, their stuck in a state they can't escape from.
