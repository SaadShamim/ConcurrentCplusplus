CLASS

time ./a.out
user	0m0.100s

with -O2
user	0m0.020s

COROUTINE

time ./a.out
user	0m0.690s

with -O2
user	0m0.400s

TASK 
time ./a.out
user	0m2.180s

-O2
user	0m2.160s


Class has no thread blocking or contexting switching, while coroutines allow for context switch as you move from one routine to another (each routine has its own stack),
TASK allow for not only context but also, thread blocking. Also, you do not have control over which task runs when (unless using locks).-O2 is faster for class
vs task because the task being done is non optimizable by TASK, since its going to yield the approximately the same amount of time no matter the optimization.
